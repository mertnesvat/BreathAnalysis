 What's Actually Happening

  Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

  Your heart rate naturally speeds up during inhale and slows down during exhale. This is RSA — it's mediated by the vagus nerve and is always present, just more visible at slow
  breathing rates.

  At normal breathing (~15 br/min), each breath cycle is ~4 seconds. Your heart is beating ~1 beat/second, so only ~4 heartbeats per breath. The HR swing is small and partially
  averages out.

  At 6-6 breathing (5 br/min), each cycle is 12 seconds. That's ~12 heartbeats per cycle. The HR has time to fully rise during the 6s inhale and fully fall during the 6s exhale,
  creating a much larger swing. If your HR oscillates between, say, 55 BPM and 73 BPM over each breath, the beat-to-beat differences become enormous — and RMSSD is literally the
  average size of those beat-to-beat differences.

  Normal breathing:       HR swing: ~5-8 BPM  → RMSSD: ~30-50 ms
  6-6 coherent breathing: HR swing: ~15-25 BPM → RMSSD: ~80-130 ms

  Is the HRV Increase "Real"?

  Both yes and no — and the distinction matters:

  YES, something real is happening:
  - The vagus nerve is genuinely activating more strongly
  - 5 br/min is near the cardiovascular system's resonance frequency (~0.1 Hz). The baroreflex loop (which regulates blood pressure) has a natural oscillation period of about 10
  seconds. Breathing at exactly that frequency drives it into resonance, maximising the vagal response
  - This is why the technique is called coherent breathing or resonance breathing — you're synchronising your breath with your cardiovascular system's natural rhythm

  NO, it's not a fair comparison:
  - RMSSD at 5 br/min and RMSSD at 15 br/min are measuring different physical phenomena. Comparing them is like measuring your height in cm vs. inches — the number changes but the
  underlying reality doesn't
  - Your 129.7ms session RMSSD doesn't mean your "baseline HRV" jumped from 40ms to 130ms. It means you executed the technique well

  What's the Actual Benefit Then?

  This is where it gets interesting. The genuine long-term effects of coherent breathing practice are:

  1. Baroreflex sensitivity increases — over weeks/months of practice, your cardiovascular system gets better at responding to the vagal signal. This shows up as higher morning HRV
  (measured before getting out of bed, at normal breathing)
  2. Parasympathetic tone at rest improves — the vagus nerve literally gets "exercised" during each session
  3. RSA amplitude at normal breathing increases — your resting HR swing during normal breathing grows

  The session RMSSD of 129.7ms is best interpreted as: "the technique is working, you're fully in resonance" — a quality signal about the session, not about your baseline fitness.
  Your true HRV baseline would need to be measured first thing in the morning, lying still, at natural breathing, over several minutes.

  Practical Implication for Your Device

  Since your device measures HRV during the session (which includes the RSA inflation), you'd want to either:

  1. Report "session HRV" separately from "baseline HRV", making clear these aren't directly comparable
  2. Use HF power (0.15–0.4 Hz band) instead of RMSSD — HF power specifically captures vagal activity independent of breathing rate
  3. Track the session HRV trend — if it goes up within a session, that's deepening relaxation, regardless of the absolute number
