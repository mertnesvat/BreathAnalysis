# Daily Practice — 6-6 Coherent Breathing

**Total time: ~9 minutes**
**Target: every day, same time of day if possible**

---

## Session Structure

### 1. Arrive (1 min)

Sit upright — chair, floor cushion, or cross-legged. Hands on knees or in your lap.
Close your eyes. Take 3–4 slow natural breaths, longer than usual, without counting.
Just let your body settle. Feel the weight of your body, relax your jaw and shoulders.

---

### 2. Coherent Breathing — 6-6 pattern (7 min)

Open the BreathMonitor app and select the **6-6 Balanced** trainer.

**Inhale for 6 seconds → Exhale for 6 seconds. Repeat.**

A few things that help:

- **Breathe through your nose** if you can. Nasal breathing activates the vagus nerve
  more than mouth breathing.
- **Let the belly lead.** Belly expands on inhale, softens on exhale. The chest follows
  naturally — don't force it.
- **Don't push the exhale.** The exhale should be passive and relaxed, not squeezed out.
  Think of it as letting go rather than blowing out.
- **The count is a guide, not a ruler.** If 6 seconds feels too long at first, that's
  fine — the rhythm will settle within the first minute.

If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, drop the count and breathe naturally for a few cycles,
then return. This usually means you over-expanded on the inhale. Slightly shallower
breaths solve it immediately.

**7 minutes = ~35 complete breaths.**

### 3. Return (1 min)

When the timer ends, let go of the count. Breathe naturally. Stay still for about
60 seconds — don't rush to open your eyes or pick up your phone. This brief rest is
when the parasympathetic effect consolidates.

Notice how your breathing feels compared to when you started.

## When to Practice

**Morning is best** if you can manage it, especially before checking your phone or
starting work. The parasympathetic effect helps blunt the cortisol spike that naturally
peaks in the first hour after waking.

**Evening (before sleep) is a strong second option.** It can help reduce pre-sleep
arousal. Avoid it within 20 minutes of a stressful task or intense exercise.

Avoid right after a meal — the breathing pattern can feel uncomfortable on a full stomach.

## Tracking (keep it simple)

After each session, note three things — it takes 20 seconds:

```
Date | Done (y/n) | How it felt (1–5) | Anything unusual today
```

For example:
```
Mar 02 | y | 3 | had coffee right before, a bit restless
Mar 03 | y | 4 | -
Mar 04 | n | - | poor sleep, skipped
```

Don't skip two days in a row. One missed day doesn't matter. Two in a row starts to
break the habit and weakens the experiment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I extend beyond 7 minutes?**
Yes. Once 7 minutes feels easy (usually by Week 2), extending to 10–15 minutes
increases the training effect. Don't force it early — consistency over duration.

**What if my mind wanders constantly?**
That's normal and not a problem for the physiological effect. The heart-rate coherence
happens regardless of whether you're mentally focused. Just gently return to the
breath count when you notice you've drifted.

**Should I use the BreathMonitor sensor?**
Use it when convenient — the pressure data lets you verify you're actually hitting the
6-6 rhythm and gives a second dataset to compare across the experiment. But don't let
forgetting the device be a reason to skip a session.

**What if 6 seconds feels too long?**
Start at 5-5 (10 seconds per cycle = 6 br/min) for the first 2–3 days, then shift to
6-6. The resonance effect is slightly lower at 6 br/min but the technique still works
and the transition to 5 br/min will feel natural after a few sessions.
