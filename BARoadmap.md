I want you to discuss with you first and then we can think about how to proceed with the project becuase this project is hardware and we can have multiple options with sensors
  maybe in the first phase we can connect all the sensors to collect data and then create analysis part but for now let's create an init file to understand what's the project and
  purpose.

  First of all I'm a vipassana meditator and I'm interested in the quality of my meditation to improve and understand my meditation better so the purpose is in the meditation session we don't have any feedback either our meditation went well or not therefore actually it's hard to improve something you can't measure.
  but if we had a way to measure then would have guessed why it went bad or how to improve would be next step might be solved in the project too. In order to understand meditation
  quality I'm thinking we can take a look to the breath patterns. for that I have a small but powerful esp32 and sensors in mind such as thermistor, piezoelectric sensor,
  humidity sensor maybe ? you can suggest I have all the sensors or I can order it no worries. So in the first phase I can record 10 mins meditation with the all the data then we
  need signal processing part to understand and interpret the data appropiately there will be learning curve there because even if we accurately understand all the data not sure
  sometimes turning to the breath is bad for your meditation it's actually good thing that you grounded. 

  So let's start with the project with init and some strategy to collect data for now.
